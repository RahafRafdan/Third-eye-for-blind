# Third-eye-for-blind

# Description:

Third Eye for Blind is a wearable device that provides enhanced environmental awareness and safety for individuals with visual impairments. It utilizes advanced sensing technology to detect obstacles and objects in the user's path, providing real-time voice alerts for immediate warning and guidance. The device is designed using high-intensity circuits for VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) applications, ensuring efficient and reliable performance.

# Key Features:

- Obstacle and object detection using advanced sensing technology.
- Real-time voice alerts for immediate warning and guidance.
- Compact and wearable design for ease of use.
- Low power consumption for extended battery life.
- Customizable settings to meet individual user preferences.

# Target Audience:

- Individuals with visual impairments who desire greater mobility, independence, and safety.

# Technical Stack:

- VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) circuits.
- Advanced sensing technology (e.g., ultrasonic sensors, infrared sensors).
- Microcontroller (Arduino NANO was used) for data processing and voice output.
- Embedded software for device control and user interface.

# Usage:

- The device is worn on a glove.
- The sensor continuously scan the surroundings for obstacles and objects.
- When an obstacle is detected, the device emits a vibration alert through the glove, providing the user with information about the obstacle's location and distance.
- The user can adjust the sensitivity and range of the sensors to suit their individual needs.

# Contribution Guidelines:

- Contributions to the project are welcome from individuals with expertise in VLSI design, embedded systems, assistive technology, and Computer Enginnering students as I'm.

# License:

- The project is released under an open-source license, allowing for free use and modification.
- 
# Additional Information:

- This project was developed as part of a university course, demonstrating the students' proficiency in VLSI design and embedded systems development.
